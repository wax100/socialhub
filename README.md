# Social Hub #

## Introduction ##
A MODX Extra which allows you to display social feed from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Youtube.

It retrieves the following content per Social Media channel:

* **Twitter:** Retrieve posts from your own user timeline and/or retrieve posts by specifying one or multiple search keywords.
* **Facebook:** Retrieve posts from your own user timeline.
* **Instagram:** Retrieve posts from your own user timeline and/or retrieve posts by specifying one or multiple search keywords. **Note**: In order to retrieve posts from other users by using the search query the app needs the public_scope permission: https://www.instagram.com/developer/authorization/
* **Youtube:** Retrieve videos from your own user channel.

### Features ###
* Stores social posts in the database for optimal performance.
* Allows you to allow/disallow individual posts to be displayed on the website with a MODX CMP.
* Comes with a snippet which accepts lots of options.

## Installation guide ##
* Install package via Package manager
* Fill in the API credentials for the Social Media accounts you want to import feed from
* Setup and run the SocialHub Cronjob located at /core/components/socialhub/elements/cronjobs/import.php

**Note: Instagram API Credentials**

In order to retrieve the Instagram Access Token you'll need to specify the Instagram API Code. You can retrieve this by visiting the following url:
https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=CLIENTID&redirect_uri=DOMAIN/assets/components/socialhub/getinstagramcode.php&response_type=code&scope=public_content

After the authorization you will be redirected to the specified redirect URI and the Instagram Code will be stored automatically for you.
Since the Instagram Code can only be used once, it will automatically be unset after it has been used to retrieve the Access Token.
